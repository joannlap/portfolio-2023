Through events, art, workshops and other cultural activities. \n\n Focus on the identity was creating a loud and clear tone of voice that was playful at the same time. 'Walk That Talk' is an expression like an order within the army. The morse code serves as a universal language with a clear purpose, much like art within underground culture. Both communicate meaning beyond words, serving as tools of connection and expression.",

The bootcamp offers over 60 workshops in various street styles, as well as lectures, parties and an evaluation program known as the Hawks Method. \n\n The visual language of Foundation Bootcamp is influenced by street and pop art.
